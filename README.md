Helps you make god gear with enchantments of your choice.

Many problems/features not yet implemented, will implement in the next versions though.

These include:

Not very flexible (must enter enchantments in the exact right way).
Hard to read.
Only works for Swords, Pickaxes, Axes, Shovels, Hoes, Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, and Boots.
Does not include xp cost.
Does not work for non-max levels.
Probably more I forgot to put here.

If you encounter anymore issues, just put them on the issues tab or tell me on discord.
