Helps you make god gear with enchantments of your choice.</br>
</br>
Many problems/features not yet implemented, will implement in the next versions though.</br>
</br>
These include:</br>
</br>
Not very flexible (must enter enchantments in the exact right way). </br>
Hard to read.</br>
Does not include xp cost.</br>
Does not work for non-max levels.</br>
Does not include compatibility</br>
Probably more I forgot to put here.</br>

If you encounter anymore issues, just put them on the issues tab or tell me on discord.</br>
